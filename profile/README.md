_Hack Clubbers at [Outernet](https://github.com/hackclub/outernet), our summer 2023 event_

Welcome to a worldwide community of high school hackers. We’re artists, writers, engineers, tinkerers, campers, filmmakers, volunteers. We **make** things. We **help** one another. We have **fun**. **[Join us ➚](https://hackclub.com/slack)**

Transparency is a core value of Hack Club, and code is not the only thing we open source. [We've open sourced our finances, workshops, events and more](https://hackclub.com/opensource).
